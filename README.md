# Mister Arcade Attract Mode
This script starts a random Arcade game from your collection every 2 Minutes. You can play the game during that time, but it will automatically switch to a new game after 2 mins. You also have to turn the script off after usage or else a random Arcade game will start after 2 mins even if you are playing a game. 

# Usage
To cycle through all MiSTer Arcade cores, copy the following files to /media/fat/Scripts Directory:
* Attract_Arcade_All.sh 
* Attract_Arcade_All_update.sh
* Attract_Arcade_All.txt

Attract_Arcade_All.txt contains a list of current Arcade cores for MiSTer that can be manually edited to suit your needs. By executing Attract_Arcade_All_Update.sh you can update the list to include newly downloaded cores.

## Horizontal or Vertical Only
For a curated list of only horizontal or vertical Arcade Games chosen because they have great looking Attract Screens copy:
* Attract_Arcade_Horiz.sh
or
* Attract_Arcade_Vert.sh

Make sure you have your Arcade roms setup correctly. [Update-all](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer) script works great for that.
