# Mister Arcade Attract Mode
This script starts a random Arcade game from your collection every 2 Minutes. You can play the game during that time, but it will automatically switch to a new game after 2 mins. You also have to turn the script off after usage or else a random Arcade game will start after 2 mins even if you are playing a game. 

# Usage:

Copy Attract-Arcade-On.sh, Attract-Arcade-Off.sh, Attract-Arcade_update.sh and Attract-Arcade.txt to /media/fat/Scripts Directory

Attract-Arcade.txt contains a list of current Arcade cores for MiSTer that can be manually edited to suit your needs. By executing Attract-Arcade-Update.sh you can update the list to include newly downloaded cores.

For a curated list of only horizontal Arcade Games chosen because they have great looking Attract Screens, you can rename Attract-Arcade-Horizontal.txt to Attract-Arcade.txt

Make sure you have your Arcade roms setup correctly. Update-all script works great for that.
