# Mister Arcade Attract Mode
This script starts a random Arcade game from your collection every 5 Minutes. You can play the game during that time, but it will automatically switch to a new game after 5 mins. You also have to turn the script off after usage or else a random Arcade game will start after 5 mins even if you are playing a game. 

# Usage:

Copy ArcadeAttractMode-On.sh, ArcadeAttractMode-Off.sh and mra.txt to /media/fat/Scripts Directory

Make sure you have your Arcade roms setup correctly. I use update-all script for that.

# Notes:

If you are worried about SD card writes, you should not use this. I've been using it a lot over the past year and my SD card (128GB) is working great.
